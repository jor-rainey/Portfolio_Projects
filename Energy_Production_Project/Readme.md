# Energy Production Data Process Walkthrough

The project can be found here - LINK

## Aims

The majority of greenhouse gas emissions globally come from energy production (72%, Climate Analysis Indicators Tool (World Resources Institute, 2017))
For this project I therefore intended to:
- Create a comparison tool for countries emissions broken down by energy source
- Allow for comparisions over time
- Show context allowing for a countries size/population
- Easy/consistent side by side visualisation
  
## Tools

- **SQL** *(PostgreSQL)*

- **Power BI** for final visualisations

## Process

### Data Collection




### Data Cleaning/Preparation
#### PostgreSQL Code

### Data Analysis

### Data Visualisation
